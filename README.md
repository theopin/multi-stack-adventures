# Multi-Stack Adventures

Welcome to the Multi-Stack Adventures repository! Here, I've documented my journey exploring various technology stacks and sharing insights into what I've accomplished with each one.

## Technologies Explored

### Fullstack
- **Summary**: Developed a comprehensive fullstack application, incorporating both frontend and backend technologies to create a robust web solution, as well as exploring how to use ci/cd strategies to test and deploy application.

### Hadoop
- **Summary**: Explored the Hadoop ecosystem for distributed data processing, storage, and analysis.
- **Actions**: Added Hadoop-related configuration files and examples to the repository.

### Kafka
- **Summary**: Integrated Apache Kafka, a powerful distributed streaming platform, into the stack.
- **Actions**: Merged Kafka components to build an event-driven architecture.

### Kubernetes
- **Summary**: Orchestrated containerized applications using Kubernetes for scalability and simplified management.
- **Actions**: Included Nginx configurations and Kubernetes manifests to showcase deployment strategies.

### Nginx
- **Summary**: Configured Nginx as a load balancer and reverse proxy for improved web service reliability.
- **Actions**: Detailed Nginx configuration files and setup information are available in this repository.

### Redis
