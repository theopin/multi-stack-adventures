# OTOT_Task_B

This is a simple starter project which provides an API structure and MongoDB connection out-of-the-box.

## Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with a key `MONGODB_URI` - the URI to connect to the MongoDB database. You can either use a local instance of MongoDB or a cluster you created in [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

## Running the app
Use `npm i` to install the required dependencies.
Use `npm start` to start the app.
